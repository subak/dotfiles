# php-mode

This updates `php-mode` with features to make it more friendly to use with PHP 5.4.  It is based on the work of:

1. Turadg Aleahmad

2. Aaron S. Hawley

3. Lennart Borgman

And all those mentioned in the ‘Contributors’ section below.

Please email any bugs or feature requests to `lobbyjones at gmail dot com` or submit them as Issues here on the Github page.  Also please include the output of `php-mode-version` in bug reports.

# Status

**28 July 2012:**  I will not be working on any PHP projects in the forseeable future.  Therefore I have not worked on adding any new features.  However, the project is not dead.  I am still accepting bug requests and will try to address them in a timely manner.  I also welcome any improvements in functionality from other developers.  Updates to `php-mode` may be infrequent, but I will continue to maintain it as best as possible.

# Features

## New Keywords

Now `php-mode` supports syntax highlighting for new keywords which were added as part of PHP 5.4, e.g. those related to traits, such as `insteadof`.  Also supported are the older keywords `clone` and `default`.

## Constants

Every magic constant and predefined constant listed on the official PHP site is included in syntax highlighted.

## Traits, Interfaces, and Namespaces

Traits, interfaces, and namespaces now appear under Imenu listings.  Fontification works properly for namespaces as well, so that code like `namespace Foo\Bar\Baz` no longer looks like a warning.  This is also true for namespace aliases, e.g. `use <namespace> as <alias>`; currently the aliased name is not listed in Imenu, but that will be addressed in the future.

## Treatment of Underscores

Underscores are treated as ‘symbol constituents’ (in Emacs terminology) so that you can use keys like M-f and M-b to move through the individual parts of a variable name like `$foo_bar_baz`.

## Chained Method Calls

A series of method calls over multiple lines will now be aligned with the `->` operator, e.g.:

    $object->foo()
           ->bar()
           ->baz();

## Nested Array Formatting

Nested function calls and `array()` structures now look better by default (or at least in my opinion).  Here is an example of the style:

    $results = Post::model()->find(
        array(
            'select'    => 'title',
            'condition' => 'postID=:postID',
            'params'    => array(':postID' => 10),
        )
    );

(Note: The alignment of the `=>` operators is not part of these changes.)

## Anonymous Functions

Anonymous functions such as

    $greet = function($name) { … };

will now appear on Imenu; in this case the name will be `$greet`.

## Flymake Support

By customizing the variable `php-executable` you can enable Flymake mode in order to see warnings and errors in real-time as you write code.

## Search Local Documentation

The key command `C-c C-f` will search the PHP website for documentation on the word under the cursor.  However, if you have a [local copy of the PHP documentation](http://us2.php.net/download-docs.php) then `php-mode` will try searching that documentation first.  All you need to do is customize the variable `php-manual-path` and give it the path to your copy of the documentation.  If `php-mode` cannot find something locally then it will still fallback on searching the PHP website.

## Executing Regions of PHP

The command `php-send-region`, which is bound to `C-c C-r` by default, will execute the selected region of PHP code.  In conjunction with the Emacs command `C-x h` you can use this to execute an entire file.  Any output will appear in a buffer called `*PHP*`.

# How to Contribute

All contributions to `php-mode` are welcome.  But please try to do the following when sending improvements or bug fixes:

1. Add your name to the list of ‘Contributors’ in this `README.md` file if it is not there already.

2. If your contribution addresses an issue on the Github project page then include a link to the relevant issue in your commit message.

3. Make sure to update the constant `php-mode-modified`.

4. However, Please do not modify `php-mode-version-number`.  I will decide what constitutes a bump in the version number.

5. Send me a pull request here on Github.  Or if you do not have a Github account then email the patches to me at `lobbyjones at gmail dot com`.  Please try to make sure the patches are acceptable input to the comand `git am`.
